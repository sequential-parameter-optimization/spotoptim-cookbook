        "## What is Success Rate?\n",
        "\n",
        "The success rate is a **rolling metric** that tracks the percentage of recent evaluations that improved upon the best value found so far. It's calculated over a sliding window of the last 100 evaluations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "- A \"success\" occurs when a new evaluation finds a value **better (smaller)** than the best found so far\n",
        "- The rate is computed over the last **100 evaluations** (window size)\n",
        "- Values range from **0.0** (no recent improvements) to **1.0** (all recent evaluations improved)\n",
        "- Helps identify when optimization is stalling and may need adjustment\n",
